# This is some Dynamic programming material

These are my annotations taken during the <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk">Dynamic Programming - Learn
to Solve Algorithmic Problems & Coding Challenges</a> course by freeCodeCamp.

The material is available for free, check it out for yourself, it is definitely
worth it.
